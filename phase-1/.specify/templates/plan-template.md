# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.x
**Primary Dependencies**: None (or as defined in spec)
**Storage**: In-memory
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Console/CLI
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: No external database
**Scale/Scope**: N/A

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Spec-Driven**: Does this plan adhere to the requirements laid out in the spec?
- [ ] **Python Console App**: Is the target platform a Python console/CLI application?
- [ ] **In-Memory Storage**: Does the plan rely only on in-memory data storage (no external databases)?
- [ ] **`src/` Directory**: Is all source code organized under a `src/` directory?
- [ ] **Clean Architecture**: Does the proposed structure follow clean-architecture practices?
- [ ] **Manual Code**: Does this plan require manual coding? (MUST be no)

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
